# CookBook
Verification and validation of software course project - Cookbook Application


# Overview

This project was developed as part of the **Verification and Validation of Software** course.  
It is a simple **Cookbook application** that allows users to add, store, and manage recipes.  
The focus of the project was not only on functionality, but also on applying **verification** (are we building the product right?) and **validation** (are we building the right product?) techniques during development.

### Verification 
- Code reviews and static analysis  
- Unit testing of core functionalities (adding, deleting, searching recipes)  
- Consistency checks on recipe data structures  

### ✔ Validation 
- Requirements gathering: recipes should be easy to add, read, and manage  
- Test cases executed based on user scenarios  
- User acceptance testing with sample recipes
